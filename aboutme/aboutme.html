                Hi, my name is Lynnardo and I'm an Air Force C-130 Mechanic that has fallen in love with code. 
                I started my coding journey through Codecademy and continued my quest for tech knowledge through LearnKey.
                I stumbled into this path from my time spent as a Foodservice Manager. I was required to know how to manipulate
                our Point of Sales systems. So, I was able to work with a learn some really basic network and database management skills
                from companies like Oracle, Nextep, and Micros. I really fell in love with the process when I had to help with the process
                launching in building app called Thrive that had to communicate with Nextep to get the proper information for the customers.
                None of those jobs called for me to learn how to code <strong>BUT</strong> they initialized the spark that required me to learn more.
